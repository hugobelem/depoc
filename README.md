# DEPOC 

A comprehensive management system built by a business owner, tailored for small Brazilian businesses.

This project took shape in response to a specific need in my last brick-and-mortar store. After closing the business, I continued developing and refining the system, now sharing it as a proud father. 👪

The system is designed to cover the entire business workflow. From purchasing goods to completing sales and issuing the Brazilian Tax Invoice (NFe - Nota Fiscal Eletrônica). These are the proposed modules under development:
