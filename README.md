# DEPOC 

A comprehensive management system built by a business owner, tailored for small Brazilian businesses.

This project took shape in response to a specific need in my last brick-and-mortar store. After closing the business, I continued developing and refining the system, now sharing it as a proud father. 👪

# Modules
The system is designed to cover the entire business workflow. From purchasing goods to completing sales and issuing the Brazilian NFe (Nota Fiscal Eletrônica). These are the proposed modules under development:
- RBAC (Role-based Acess Control) ⚒️
- Supply Chain Management (SCM) ⚒️
- Inventory Management ⚒️
- Human Resources ⚒️
- Finance & Accounting ⚒️
- Sales & CRM ⚒️
- Brazilian Tax Invoice (Nota Fiscal) ⚒️

# Stack
- Backend
  - Python, along with the Django framework.
  - AWS: EC2 for hosting, RDS for PostgreSQL, and Route 53 for DNS management.
  - Deployment is automated with GitHub Actions.
